# photoplatform2020

## Background

In early 2020 I looked at some pictures on the website of a local photographer. Apart from usual shootings, the company also took pictures of the graduation ceremonies of my former university. Most of the photo albums on this website were password protected and I received a valid password from my university to view the pictures of my graduation ceremony. After entering the password, I was able to see all the pictures in the album in a gallery view or a single picture in a single-image view.


## Vulnerability Description

While browsing through all the photos I noticed that there are some GET-parameters in the URL.

### gallery view
The **gallery view url** had the following scheme:
<pre>www.[URLofVulnWebsite].de/index.php?nav=showgrp&<b>subcat=[AlbumID]</b>&HC=1000</pre>
- The parameter **subcat=[AlbumID]** is a three or four digit number, which is used to access a specific album.
  
### single-photo view
The single-photo view url had the following scheme:
<pre>www.[URLofVulnWebsite].de/includes/thumb.php?<b>iid=[ImageID]</b>&<b>eid=[AlbumID]</b>&<b>maxwidth=[Width]</b></pre>
- The parameter **eid=[AlbumID]** is used as explained above.
- The parameter **iid=[ImageID]** defines which image of the current album is shown.
- The parameter **maxwidth=[Width]** determines the width of the displayed image. Usually the default parameter was set to 500, which led to a downscaling of the image. However, by increasing this number to an arbitrary value larger than the width of the original file, the original file is displayed with the best quality.

I tried to manipulate those parameters. I found out that not only I was able to access all the pictures of my graduation ceremony, but I could also access any image in any album at the server with a direct url (even if it was protected with an unknown password). This vulnerability can be classified as [Broken Access Control](https://owasp.org/www-community/Broken_Access_Control) which could be attacked by [Forced Browsing](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Forced_browsing).

## Exploitation Examples

For example it would have been possible to access the gallery view of the album with the ID : 8330
<pre>www.[URLofVulnWebsite].de/index.php?nav=showgrp&subcat=8330&HC=1000</pre>

The access of the 1st image of this album, with a width of 2000px, would have been possible with the following ID:
<pre>www.[URLofVulnWebsite].de/includes/thumb.php?iid=1&eid=8330&maxwidth=2000</pre>

To make the company aware of the severity I wrote an exploit. This could have been used to download a given number of photos of each album (within an AlbumID range), with an arbitrary width. As the website is not available anymore I ![published](files/AutomaticPhotoExtraction.py) it for educational purposes.

## Additional Remarks
The server even had the possibility for an anonymous ftp login, which was reported to the company as well:

## Disclosure Process

After consulting my IT security Professor, [Prof. Felix Freiling](https://www.cs1.tf.fau.de/person/felix-freiling/) of FAU Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg's IT Security Infrastructures chair, I decided to notify the company immediately: The fact that especially the private shootings were tagged with the customer's name were very critical.
